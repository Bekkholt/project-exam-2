## Description

Holidaze Bookings is a booking site where you can book your venue of interest. You can also publish your own venue for others to be able to book your place.

This website is made as my Project Exam 2 during my studies at Noroff.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
